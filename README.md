# fixes.inc

Community written solutions to SA:MP bugs.

# Introduction

SA:MP is beta software written by a small team in their spare time, thus it has bugs (as does all software). Some of these have been known for a long time but are low priority due to their minor effects, others go undiscovered for a long time. Many of these bugs have solutions which can be implemented in PAWN (and this may be simpler than implementing them in the SA:MP source code). This include aims to collect fixes for as many of these bugs as possible from the community (i.e. anyone who has a fix) together in to one easy to use place for everyone's benefit.

# Use

To use this, simply include it after the default SA:MP functions, but before third party includes:
```Pawn
#include <a_samp>
// Any default re-definitions should go here.
//#undef MAX_PLAYERS
//#define MAX_PLAYERS 10
#include <fixes>
#include <other>
```

To disable any fix for whatever reason simply do:
```Pawn
#define FIX_<name> 0
```

For example, to disable all the file.inc fixes if you always correctly check the file handle, do:
```Pawn
#include <a_samp>
#define FIX_file_inc 0
#include <fixes>
#include <other>
```

All the names of the fixes are single words, and are all listed with their fix descriptions below.

If you only have one script running on your server (i.e. no Filter Scripts), you can use this define to improve the fixes.inc code:
```Pawn
#include <a_samp>
#define FIXES_Single 1
#include <fixes>
#include <other>
```

# Options

There are a few options for improved execution of this script. Define these symbols as "1" before you include fixes.inc (remove them or set them to 0 to disable them):
- FIXES_Single - You only have one script running (no filterscripts), simplify the code.
- FIXES_SilentKick - When a player is kicked for illegal mods/vehicles, don't send them a message.
- FIXES_Debug - Additional information in the server console.

A few fixes are disabled by default, to enable them all do:
```Pawn
#define FIX_GetPlayerPoolSize 1 // Might break scripts, that is why it is disabled by default.
#define FIX_GetPlayerDialog 1 // Adds a new function, not really the point of this include.
#define FIX_random 1 // I don't think negative numbers not working is a bug.
#define FIX_file_inc 1 // This will enable all the "fwhatever" fixes.
#define FIX_HideMenuForPlayer_2 1 // Hide a specific menu, not just whatever the current one is.
```

# Expansion

The file is fairly well documented, with a list of the currently (hopefully) fixed bugs at the top. If you know of others, or have solutions for others, it would be greatly appreciated if you could post them in this topic (following the structure already laid out). The fixes also need extensive testing to find bugs in the fixes.

Again, this is a community project, merely managed by [Y_Less](https://github.com/Y-Less/) - if anyone has comments, contributions, criticisms etc. please post them in this topic. This includes additions to source code, documentation, presentation, translations (mainly of this post - multiple versions of the include should be avoided to reduce fragmentation), or any other related area you can think of.

# Other Fixes

There are a few other includes which aim to fix issues too large to be included here:

- [Timerfix](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=435525) - [Dan..](https://github.com/udan11)'s fixes to make "SetTimer" and "SetTimerEx" vastly more accurate in their delays.
- [SQLitei](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=303682) - [Slice](https://github.com/oscar-broman/)'s fixes and improvements for many SQLite functions.

This software is explicitly designed to solve bugs, not cause them, but there may still be bugs.

The most likely cause of bugs is certain combinations of disabled fixes. Some fixes are inter-mixed and while they SHOULD work when the fixes they are combined with are disabled, not every combination has been tested. There are literally billions of possible combinations - if you find one that doesn't compile or work, please tell us.
